emulation:
-opaque texture pixels
	-something better than my 0xfe alpha hack
	-finish implementing, not just sprite
-masked drawing (silent hill)
-subtractive blending?
-VRAM read
-texture mirroring
-use software polygon clip test, not opengl clipping
-Texture window: repeating instead of scaling - difficult!
-lines, dots as 1 unit width rectangle
-check for clut changes

optimization/features:
-change 11bit gpu integers to union bitfields - probably won't help much, but hey, it'll be elegant :)
-fix psx texture pixel co-ords so we can turn on bilinear filtering and antialiasing.
-rewrite texturing
	-check vram uploads for updates to subtexture
-rewrite (and fix) blending
-render to texture for psx front/back buffer
-implement black & STP pixels as stencil
	-needed for masked drawing anyway...
	-(would this also fix FF7 outlines when bilinear filtered textures are enabled?)
-upscale textures
-pixel shaders

Pcsx:
-save states
-fullscreen toggle
-gui config
-fps display
