There are several toggles in PCSX to allow you to modify emulation
behavior; this may allow certain games to work that would not otherwise
function. These can all be found at Configuration -> CPU.

* Disable XA Decoding:
    Disables XA sound, which can improve game speed.

* SIO IRQ Always Enabled:
    This should be enabled for certain memcards/gamepads.

* SPU IRQ Always Enabled:
    Compatibility tweak; should probably be left off.

* Black & White Movies:
    Allows movies to be shown faster on slower systems.

* Disable CD Audio:
    Disable CD Audio for a performance boost.

* Enable Console Output:
    Dumps the PSX emulator output to the console.

* Enable Interpreter CPU:
    Enables interpretive emulation.
    This is often more compatible, but at the price of emulation speed.

Currently, PCSX-Reloaded does not support CD-DA tracks when loading
image files. In this case, to experience music in games such as Tekken
and Wipeout 2097, a CD emulation software should be used in conjunction
with the emulator. DAEMON Tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc) and CDEmu
(http://cdemu.sourceforge.net) were tested to work under Windows and
GNU/Linux respectively.
