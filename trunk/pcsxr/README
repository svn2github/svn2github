PCSX-df
-------------------------------

PCSX-df is a forked version of the dead PCSX emulator, with a nicer interface
and several improvements to stability and functionality.

PCSX-df uses the PSEMU plugin interface to provide most functionality;
without them, you will not be able to use it to play games. Debian users
can find many plugins in the apt archive as 'psemu-<type>-<name>'. PCSX-df
provides a number of plugins (modified from the most popular free PSEMU
plugins) to provide basic functionality out of the box.

PCSX-df has a very capable Internal HLE BIOS that can run many games without
problems. It is recommended that you use it. However, if you own a real
Playstation, you may be able to use your own BIOS image. PCSX-df will find
it in ~/.pcsx/bios/ if you place it there. This can improve compatibility,
especially with certain games and with the use of memory cards.

See the doc/ folder in the source, or /usr/share/doc/pcsx/ on Debian systems,
for more detailed information on PCSX-df. A UNIX manpage is also available.
