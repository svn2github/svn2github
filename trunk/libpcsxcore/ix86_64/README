This is the AMD64 dynamic recompiler.
Made from opcodes from PCSX2 0.9.3 and the x86 recompiler modified to fit.  ie. currently no AMD64/SSE specific code advantages.

Note that this recompiler currently requires all variables, data heaps, function pointers, etc to be within a 4 Gig range of each other.  While this is currently the case through luck and dirty hacks, a proper fix should be implemented.
