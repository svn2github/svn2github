Release users:
 To compile, run the following commands. You will need GTK2 headers installed.

 1. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 2. make
 3. sudo make install

 Run 'pcsx' to start PCSX-df. It will search for plugins and try to
 configure itself automatically.

Darcs users:
You'll want the latest and greatest autoconf and autotools;
automake1.9 and autoconf 2.59 should be sufficient, though.

 bash autogen.sh
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 make
 sudo make install
