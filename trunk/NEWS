PCSX-df: bringing clarity, joy, and a nice GUI to PCSX.

RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

You should remove your old ~/.pcsx directory before using PCSX-df, to
avoid any possible compatibility issues, such as missing folders. Remember
that memcards and savestates are kept there, so be sure to copy them out first!
