Testing of changes can be tested by running
./cfgDFX11Video --CFG
or
./cfgDFX11Video --ABOUT
at the command line.

The .glade file that is generated needs to be copied to the /usr/share/psemu directory before this plugin can be used.

The peops-video top-level directory needs to have the makefile edited to work with whichever version of gcc is installed on your computer. Edit the file makes/mk.x11 and change the CC and LD values appropriately (the current value is gcc, which should work for most people). This file also specifies the name and version number of the plugin.

The makes/mk.x11 file defines the version in the filename; the gpuPeopsSoft.rc defines the version as displayed in the drop-down list.

To compile the SDL version of the plugin, rather than the X11 version, change the VERSION line in the makes/mk.x11 file appropriately.
