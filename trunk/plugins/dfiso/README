Plugin for PCSX-DF supporting PSX-Imagefiles
============================================

This plugin lets you use raw image files from your playstation files. Audio (CDDA) is supported,
you need to have your images created with the CDRDAO toolset and the .toc files with the same 
name like the .bin are needed for most games.

This work was inspired by the free source code of Linuzappz' cdriso-plugin. Support for compressed
images has been dropped and most of the code totally rewritten and relicensed under terms of GPL.

This plugin is part of the PCSX-DF project you can find here: http://pcsx-df.sf.net

Have fun and help us improving the code by visiting our homepage and send errors and improvements.
